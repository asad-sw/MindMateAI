# 🧠 MindMate AI  
*An Agentic AI-Powered Assistant for Mental Health Triage and Clinic Support*  
**Built for the IBM TechXchange 2025 Hackathon – Build with Agentic AI Challenge**

---

## 📌 Overview

**MindMate AI** is an intelligent assistant designed to support mental health triage in community clinics and under-resourced healthcare settings. It automates pre-visit intake, screens for psychological distress using IBM's **watsonx.ai** platform, and provides clinic staff with an actionable dashboard to prioritize patient care.

Our mission is to reduce staff burden, improve patient flow, and ensure timely intervention for those in need.

## 🎯 The Problem

Clinics in underserved areas face critical challenges:

- Limited staff
- High patient loads
- Delayed recognition of urgent mental health cases

This often leads to poor patient outcomes.

**MindMate AI** acts as an "agentic" first line of defense that reasons about patient needs and delivers actionable intelligence—before a human ever sees the case.
